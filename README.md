## *Creating a Movie Database by using the "Extract, Transform, Load" Process*

### I have been asked to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, transforms it, and loads it into existing tables.

The assignment consists of four deliverables:
1. The first is an ETL function that reads three files--one from Wikipedia, one from Kaggle, and one from MovieLens, which is CSV data.
2. The second deliverable extracts and transforms the Wikipedia data.
3. The third deliverable extracts and transforms the Kaggle data.
4. The fourth deliverable creates the movie database by adding the movies DataFrame to a SQL database.
